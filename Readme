I implemented 2 models

The first one is based on occurrence.
The second is based on confusion matrix.

I am used to work with csv so I transfer the format of txt to csv for count_1w.

Also in matrices folder, you can find 4 csv represent 4 confusion matrices seprately as deletion, insertion, substitution and transition. 
The first column of matrix refer to the related 2 error chars and the second column refer to the occurrence of the error in spell-errors.txt.
